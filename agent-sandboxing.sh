# Multi-Agent Orchestration Functions for Claude Code
# =====================================================
#
# Problem: When you run `claude` in a directory, it creates a `.claude/` folder
# containing conversation history, cache, and context. If multiple AI agents
# (Forge, Axiom, Jarvis) work in the same directory, they would share this
# context, leading to:
#   - Agent A seeing Agent B's conversation history
#   - Confused context ("Why am I suddenly working on frontend when I was doing backend?")
#   - Unpredictable behavior as agents inherit each other's mental state
#
# Solution: Each agent MUST work in its own git worktree directory. This ensures:
#   - Complete isolation of conversation history
#   - Clean mental model for each agent
#   - Predictable, reproducible behavior
#
# Think of it like this: Would you want your backend developer randomly seeing
# and acting on conversations your frontend developer had yesterday? That's what
# happens without these guards.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Source this file in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
#   2. Create worktrees: `create_agent_worktrees` from your main repo
#   3. Launch agents: `cd ../project-forge && forge`

# Each agent function enforces that it can only run in its designated worktree
